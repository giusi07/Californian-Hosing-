# Housing Prices
Implement from scratch the ridge regression algorithm for regression with square loss (lecture notes on “Linear prediction”). It is OK to use libraries for linear algebra and basic data manipulation (e.g., Numpy and Pandas). Apply the algorithm to the prediction of the label medianHouseValue in this dataset. Study the dependence of the cross-validated risk estimate on the parameter alpha of ridge regression. Try using PCA to improve the risk estimate.
